UWCMG success rate graphs


#### table columns:
* Disorder - \[free text\]
* PI - \[free text\]
* HLB_disorder - \[Y|N\] (optional, is this an HLB disorder)
* cohort - \[Y|N\] (required, is this is a cohort project)
* overall - \[first_pass_done|complete|first_pass_in_progress|in_sequencing|exclude\] (required, current status of analysis)
* Strategy - \[free text\] (optional)
* gene_name - \[NA|gene_name\] (required, either NA if unsolved or name of gene if solved)
* Analyst - \[free text\] (optional)
* Analyst2 - \[free text\] (optional)
* Novel_disease_gene - \[Y|N|NA\] (required, either NA if unsolved, or per definitions, Y if solved and gene is novel, or N if solved and gene is not novel)
* nkindreds - \[integer\] (required, number of kindreds for this phenotype or gene)
* Novel_phenotype_or_expansion - \[Y|N|NA\] (required, either NA if unsolved, or per definitions, Y if solved and phenotype is novel/expansion, or N if solved and phenotype is not novel/expansion)
* Solved - \[Y|N|NA\] (required, Y if solved or N if not solved)
* Model - \[AD|AR|AR consanguineous|de novo|X-linked|unknown\] (required, model used in analysis of disorder, determine model per flowchart)
* Mapping_Data - \[Y|N|NA\] (required, Y if mapping data is available/possible to obtain for the kindred, or N if kindred is too small for homozygosity/linkage)
* isNovel - \[Y|N|NA\] (required, either NA if unsolved, or Y if involves novel gene OR novel phenotype, or N if both gene and phenotype are not novel; can be generated by conditinonal in Excel, e.g. =IF(OR(J49="NA",L49="NA"),"NA",IF(OR(J49="Y",L49="Y"),"Y","N")) )
